                    <h1 class="title">Web Design</h1>
                    <h2 class="hed1">My Process</h2>
                    <p class="text1">I have an intricate process that I go through to make my sites. I ask you a few questions about your business, do some research and I’m on my way. I send you some low fidelity wireframes of the site, and we review them until you are satisfied. I then go on to make a higher fidelity mockup, and recieve more feedback from you. I may make a prototype if necessary, but often, it’s off to the races!
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="hed2">Specialties</h2>
                    <p class="text2">As a designer and developer, I specialize in UI(User Interface) Design. My primary experience is in sites for businesses, but I have worked with web applications before, and am willing to do so. I focus on designing for the future. I follow trends that other companies are moving to, while keeping an original flare that makes my sites look like no others out there. I have lots of experience, and have gone through many trials and trebulations to get to where I am.</p>

                    <h1 class="title">Web Development</h1>
                    <h2 class="hed1">For Businesses</h2>
		    <p>I build the website that will cause your business to thrive. I spend time making sure that my sites follow best practices, looking good on all devices, making them accessable for all, and fast and efficient.
                    <h2 class="hed2">More Developer Information</h2>
                    <p class="text2">As a developer, I work with many tools every day. My primary focus is on Vue JS, Nuxt.js, and Vuetify. Although my primary focus is static sites, I can build server rendered sites, single page applications, and more.</p>

                    <h1 class="title">Helping Your Business</h1>
                    <h2 class="hed1">Being Found Online</h2>
                    <p class="text1">Today, it is a necessity that your business has a strong online presence. A good website is a huge part of that, but not always enough. Basic search engine optimization can help by a lot. I run through a checklist to make sure your are ready for Google. I also connect you to services like Google My Business, so that your business is listed on Google, and so that people can see reviews, pictures, and more.</p>
                    <h2 class="hed2">DevOps and More</h2>
                    <p class="text2">When a website is created, it needs to be put on a server so that your customers can access it. My primary servers are shared, but I can also set up VPS and dedicated. I also make sure that everyone at your business has an email address that uses your domain’s name, keeping your emails simple and professional. I can set up a custom domain for you and connect it to your server. I handle all of the tricky parts of running a website so you don’t have to.</p>

                    <h1 class="title">Pricing</h1>
                    <h2 class="hed1">The Value of My Work</h2>
                    <p class="text1">Creating a website is an intricate process. It requires research, brainstroming, creating a design, making that design into code, and setting up the site. Often times, things need to be revised and sometimes, completely remade. A lot goes on on my end. This work can take a long time and is quite a bit to do. Because of this, I set up a pricing method that is fair to me and values my work. At the same time, I strive to make my services affordable and just, so that you have a great website at a great price.</p>
                    <h2 class="hed2">My Pricing Structure</h2>
                    <p class="text2">So how do I charge for my work, then? For the creation of the site, I use a fixed rate strategy. This assures that no matter how long it takes to complete the site, the price is equal to the amount of work that needs to be done. Standard shared servers are on me, and I charge a yearly fee for the domain, which depends on what domain you would prefer. If you would like to learn more, please get in touch with me, as I am happy to answer any of your questions and would love to work with you.</p>
